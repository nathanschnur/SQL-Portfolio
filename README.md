# SQL-Portfolio
### **Welcome to Nathan Schnur's SQL Portfolio...**

Hi there! This portfolio contains numerous examples of SQL that I have worked on throughout my database management, systems analysis, machine learning and other analytics courses. Unless otherwise noted, these projects were completed using mock data. I invite you to explore around and reach out at my LinkedIn if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat! Thanks!
