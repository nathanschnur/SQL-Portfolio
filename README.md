# SQL-Portfolio
### **Welcome to Nathan Schnur's SQL Portfolio...**

Hi there! This portfolio contains numerous examples of SQL that I have worked on throughout my database management, systems analysis, machine learning and other analytics courses. Unless otherwise noted, these projects were completed using mock data. I invite you to explore around and reach out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-schnur/">here</a> if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat! Thanks!

## Featured Projects
* Workout Studio Analysis <a href="https://github.com/nathanschnur/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Workout%20Studio%20Full%20Project">SQL</a>: In order to complete this project, I used a mock data set to create and alter all required tables. Then executing a series of different inserts, joins, and views, I was able to answer numerous questions regarding the dataset. An example of this is using inner joins to the client, attendance and class tables together, and then running a query to determine which clients have outstanding balances from classes they attended.
  

* Dry Cleaning Analysis <a href="https://github.com/nathanschnur/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Dry%20Cleaning%20Data%20Joins%20%2B%20Views">SQL</a>: For this project, I used a mock data set about the business processes of a dry cleaning store. To accurately capture all the information I desired, I had to create tables to show customer, invoice, and item data. Pulling from these tables, I was able to answer related business questions, such as querying from the customer and invoice tables to determine which customers picked up their dry cleaning orders in a selected month.
